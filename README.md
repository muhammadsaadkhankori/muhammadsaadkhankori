# Hi 👋, I'm Muhammad Saad

A passionate AI, Computer Vision, and immersive technologies enthusiast. I live and breathe in the Metaverse 🪐!

- 🥽 I’ve been **Developing** 🔧 **ZapAura**, a Mozilla Hubs-based platform where avatars walk, talk, and teach! 🚀 With full-body avatars, real-time lip-syncing, and a super-smart AI teaching assistant powered by a custom LLaMA model 🦙, we’re constantly adding cool features, including visual avatars that respond with interactive animations. Ready for the next level? 🌐
- 🌱 I’m always **learning** new tricks to make avatars even cooler—currently working on multimedia-based avatar assistant development! 🎨
